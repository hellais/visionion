visionion
=========

visionion aims to provide a webbased visualization tool for Tor metrics data.

The [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/index.html) project is primarily a system to provide a user with anonymity while on the internet. 
It adds to this some means for censorship prevention as adversaries try to block access to Tor alltogether. 
The Tor infrastructure is comprised of several types of network nodes, and a lot thereof. 

Visualizing all the parts of this network in a meaningful way is propably not possible but of course insights can be drawn from combining different aspects and sources in one view. 
Visionion aims to integrate and visualize all available data in a generic and easily extensible fashion. 
These generic views can then be combined and tailored to elucidate structural patterns and hidden aspects in the data.




Tor Metrics Data
----------------
The project website provides the [currently available data in JSON](https://metrics.torproject.org/graphs/) as well as an [overview of metrics descriptor formats](https://metrics.torproject.org/index.html) and the [raw data](https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html). 
It's currently saved to a PostgreSQL database ([SQL schema](https://gitweb.torproject.org/metrics-web.git/blob/HEAD:/db/tordir.sql)).




Usage Scenario
--------------
A user might just have some simple questions: how many relays were there running in the past 3 months in .de? How much bandwidth was provided by relays running Tor version 0.2.3.x.?     
Such questions might just ask for a number and therefor need no visualization at all. 
When a series of numbers is asked for or when information needs get more complex because they involve different factors and sources of data a visualization can be very handy to ease comprehension of the answer. 
Even a simple graph of values over a period of time can be grasped much more easily than a list of numbers. 
Visually combining and contextualizing different aspects of data in one place can help understand causes, effects and correlations.   
When there is a problem to which not only the right answer but also the right question is not known a visualization can help understand what's going on in the first place. 
Certainly this is an ambitious task for which the visualization has to provide interactive controls and visual malleablity.      

How to achieve all this? 
Basically, take all network graphs and merge them into one single graph with plenty of options. 
Users should be able to navigate into any factor (bridge vs. relay, country, flags, Tor software version, operating system, EC2 cloud bridge or not) and learn the total relay number or advertised bandwidth or bandwidth history for their selection. 

**1** 
the most prominent usecase is the timeline with a graph representing volumina of bandwidth or number of hosts or number of clients etc. on the vertical axis   
**1a** 
it should also be possible to layer timeline graphs for the same time period but with different subject on each other to compare eg consumed bandwidth and number of clients   
**2** 
now imagine a plane orthogonal to the graph, representing some other data at that point in time eg adding to the graph of linux driven relays a cake diagram of all operating systems driving relays   
**3** 
now imagine a third plane showing geogrgraphic distribution of linux driven relays and how much bandwidth each of them handles, the imaginary center of linux driven traffic at the crosspoint of the first two planes   
**4** 
now add markers for certain events: the day when traffic from linux driven relays peaked, the day it hit an alltime low, the days it plummeted, the days it spiked etc.   
**5** 
show the biggest nodes for a given metric and their share of the total  

**1** 
represents the usecase that's presently handled by the Tor metrics project [graph visualizations](https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html). 
**1a** 
is available as a prototype of [interactive graphs](http://tigerpa.ws/tor_metrics/).   
**2** 
attempts to combine different visualization techniques like timeline and cake diagram. 
Different visualizations get rendered on different layers. 
Control shifts from the visualization framework to web application.   
**3** 
introduces the geographical dimension which is not very strongly represented in the raw data but nonetheless an interesting perspective.   
**4** 
points the user in directions that might be worth to explore. 
It will need some analytics in the background.   
**5** 
checks (de-) centralizations in the infrastructure   




Technical Overview
------------------
In a nutshell:
* Tor metrics data get's imported into a [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) database.   
* Client side application framework is [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org/).   
* Visualization Framework is [D3.js](http://d3js.org/).   
* Supported web browsers are Chrome and Firefox. Others might work as well.
Most of the visualization facets get rendered seperatly, on seperate planes/DIVs.   
The application prepares the joins and our eyes carry them out (the DB is well off ;) .   


**Visualization framework** 
[D3.js](http://d3js.org/) is a [leading](http://www.netmagazine.com/features/top-20-data-visualisation-tools "The top 20 data visualisation tools") data visualization framework for the web. 
It keeps a strong link between the data and it's visual representation, expresses it in a nice declarative and CSS-like style, provides an impressive set of features and renders to SVG.   


**Database** 
Since the data schema is quite flat and in a certain flux a NoSQL database seems appropriate. 
[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) was [chosen](http://kkovacs.eu/cassandra-vs-mongodb-vs-couchdb-vs-redis "Cassandra vs MongoDB vs CouchDB vs Redis vs Riak vs HBase vs Couchbase vs Neo4j vs Hypertable vs ElasticSearch vs Accumulo vs VoltDB vs Scalaris comparison") because of it's JavaScript support which promises nice integration with client side logic. 
Since the complexity of the underlying data is rather limited MongoDBs query capabilities, although less expressive than SQL, should be sufficient. 
With a visualization tool the most interesting joins are anyway those that are carried out in the eyes of the user.   
The ability to store JavaScript-code in the MongoDB might help in the development of an analyzer toolkit. 
Support for geo-data could be beneficial either (no other NoSQL database has that so easily available AFAIK).  


**Web application framework** 
[Angular.js](http://angularjs.org/) was chosen because of it's declarative style and it's attractive approach to routing and HTML extensions ([discussion](http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2012/08/01/rich-javascript-applications-the-seven-frameworks-throne-of-js-2012/ "Rich JavaScript Applications â€“ the Seven Frameworks")). 
It integrates nicely [with](http://briantford.com/blog/angular-d3.html "Using the D3.js Visualization Library with AngularJS") D3.js. and [with](http://square.github.com/cube/) MongoDB (also [here](http://square.github.com/cubism/)).  




Tor network terminology
-----------------------
The Tor network is comprised of a lot of different nodes. 
All these nodes operate - despite their different functions - from the same software, just with different configuration flags set. 
A single node can be in _most_ categories at the same time and in _every_ category over time.  
 
_Nodes_ are all the actors that form the network. 
Nodes encompass clients, bridges and relays.    
_Clients_ are the end users, connecting to the Tor network to anonymously use the internet.   
_Bridges_ are the nodes that clients connect to to circumvent attempts to block access to Tor.   
_Relays_ are the nodes that form the actual Tor network which provides anonymity. 
Relays encompass guard nodes, middle nodes, exit nodes and directory nodes.
_Guard_ nodes function as entry points to an anonymized route through the Tor network. 
They are reached by the client either directly or, if a censor blocks them, through a bridge.
_Middle_ nodes function as intermediary steps on that route.
_Exit_ nodes function as exit points, leaving the Tor network and continuing to the destination on the internet.
_Directory_ nodes provide some auxiliary services to the Tor network.

	nodes				everything in the tor network
		clients			the users
		bridges			special entry points for clients that need to circumvent blocking 
		relays			the actual anonymization network
			guard		entry points into the network (accessed by client directky or by bridge)
			middle		intermediary nodes on anonymizing route
			exit		now anonymized, continue route to actual destination on the internet
			directory	some auxiliary services 


It's quite common that a relay is guard node, middle node, exit node, and directory mirror at the same time and that same node can be used as client at any time. 
Also, the node may have been configured as bridge before or after being configured as a relay.   
But there are two exceptions to the general rule:   
1) a node can't be a client and a relay or bridge at the same time.   
2) a node can't be a bridge and a relay at the same time.

**a more detailed description of the different actors**
* client  
Tor doesn't log anything at clients, but only at bridges and directory mirrors. 
Bridges are obvious, but directory mirrors maybe not so much. 
The idea is to count network status requests per day and per country, aggregate that data for all directory mirrors, and derive the number of clients from that number.   
The "time to download files over Tor" and "timeouts and failures of downloading files over Tor" parts are learned from clients run by the Tor project itself.   
See https://metrics.torproject.org/formats.html for details: "Second, we describe the numerous aggregate statistics that relays publish about their usage (PDF), including byte histories, directory request statistics, connecting client statistics, bridge user statistics, cell-queue statistics, exit-port statistics, and bidirectional connection use."   
* bridge  
Bridges are simply nodes with a I-want-to-be-a-bridge bit set in their configuration. 
However, whether a node is a bridge or a relay determines to some extend what data we have about that node. 
For example, we don't have country information about bridges, but we have that for relays.
* guard node     
* middle node  
* exit node  
* directory mirror

Data Schema Outline
-------------------
The initial database import schema has only 2 collections for all node types: 'relay' and'client'. 
Documents of type "bridge", "guard", "middle", "exit" and "directory" will be added to the collection named "relay", documents of type "client" will be added to the collection named "client". 
These two collections contain all raw data as it is imported into the database. 
Further collections - equaling views in SQL-land - will be constructed through map/reduce style aggregation. They are described further below.


**Relays and bridges**  
The information available about the different types of relay and bridge nodes varies to some degree. 
You wouldn't put them all together in one table if you used an RDBMS but that's okay with a document centric store like MongoDB since there is no performance penalty to pay for scarcely populated objects. 
OTOH MongoDB as a typical NoSQL store provides no joins which means that for retrieval purposes it can be very beneficial to have all data in one big table.  
That one big table for all relay and bridge types has the additional advantage of providing maximum extensibility and malleability. 
MongoDB will never complain if some documents inserted to it suddenly contain a new field or are missing another one. 
It couldn't be easier to add new data types, change data sources or modify value spaces. 
The client side code can instantly access these new fields (at least as soon as it knows how to ask for them).

_flags_
On closer inspection it became clear that most of the flags actually serve so little purpose that we will not use them in the visualization thereby trying to avoid visual clutter and distraction. 
They will remain in the scheme and will be imported in the Databae but will not be aggregated.  
Only the flags "Fast", "Stable", "BadExit" and "Authority" will be aggregated for the following types of relays: 
				Fast	Stable	BadExit	Authority
	Guard		x		x
	Middle		x		x
	Exit		x		x		x
	Directory 							x


**Clients**  
Clients OTOH have their own datatype because client data is - unlikey all relay data - never collected at the client nodes themselves (otherwise anonymity could be compromised). 
Instead client data is derived from relay data through special means and is already aggregated when it is imported into the MongoDB.

	LEGEND --------------------------------------------------------------------

**JSON schema**  
The above has been transformed into a JSON [schema](schema.json).   
If the outline above and the schema get out of sync, the *schema is authorative*.   
For information about JSON Schema see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Schema) and the [Draft Specification](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-zyp-json-schema/?include_text=1).

The purpose of the schema is twofold: combined with a [validator](https://github.com/garycourt/JSV) it can provide some control over what data get's inserted into the database. Since MongoDB doesn't perform any consistency checks this can be useful to detect if somethings goes wrong.
More importantly the validator can spot data that's not handled by the schema and trigger the addition of an appropriate (probably rather generic) query interface to the visualization GUI.




Data Reprocessing
-----------------
Aggregation of imported data is essential to this project, for several reasons:
* the relay/bridge data is ordered by relay/bridge by date but most of the time we will not want to look at individual relays/bridges but at all relays/bridges together or at least at a group of relays/bridges sharing certain attributes.   
* having all relay/bridge data sitting very generically in one big table has the disadvantage of being slow.    
Dividing that big table of imported data into specialized collections according to the visual needs of the interface is a prerequisite for a responsive and interactive visualization.    
* what's even more important is that the data as it is gathered and imported into the DB reflects the technical structure of the network but not necessarily the logical structure that we'd like to examine and understand.   
For example data from clients and from relays is collected in different ways and imported in different collections but the relation between the number of clients connecting to the network and the bandwidth available to them is one of the crucial characteristics of the network. 
Also the data can be of very different nature: percentages don't easily compare to absolute values and also not all absolute values in one category add up to a meaningful sum because value spaces overlap.   
Therefor it's important to carefully select, construct and arrange meaningful and actually comparable configurations.   

Step 1 - topical aggregation:     
The aggregated collections will be those that actually provide the data to the visualization frontend. They are mappings from the imported data to the concepts that drive the interface. I call these aggregations step 1 collections or topical collections.    
Step 2 - formal aggregation:   
A second step of aggregation will consolidate these topical collections in precomputed timespans, regions, groups of node types etc to improve retrieval performance. They are reductions of the still very detailed data derived from the imports in step 1. I call these aggregations step 2 collections or formal collections.    
Step 3 - indexing:    
All these aggregated collections will then have to be enhanced by indices to gain further speed advantages.   
Additionally indices on the big "relay" collection of imported data have to facilitate generic and unforseen queries as much as possible.    


**Understanding the data**
The imported data is quite diverse and heterogeneous. The table below tries to capture its different dimensions.    
"Mode" refers to the essential quality of the thing being counted. 
This may be the numbers of hardware instances, software characteristics, measures of quality of service, number of users. 
We import data in two collections: relays and clients. The fields in these collections overlap only in one case: country. Countries are a powerful metaphor and because of this overlap they become a prominent player in the visualization, but they are still just a medium, not a subject of discourse. We are not interested in countries per se, we just use them to make connections.     
"Measure" documents if the numbers denote absolute values, percentages, averages etc. 
Obviously one would compare apples with oranges by comparing an absolute value like the number of available Bridges with an relative value like uptime. 
"Unit" is not much different from Measure, mainly reflecting if the field is single value or multi valued.
"Upper limit" denotes the upper limit of the value space. For percentages it's 100. For each relay type it's the total number of relays - the important implication being that each relay can simultaneously belong to multiple types: the types alltogether don't add up to the number of relays, the're up to 4 times more. Only Bridges are distinct.

"scat" is short for scattering (or spreading) and indicates how evenly distributed the value space is. This needs further thinking.

Overview data on clients and relays:   
We have some very general data on all relays and bridges: total count, software version, operating system version, total bandwidth provided and consumed. 
Correspondingly we have quite general data on clients: how many clients in total were connected to the tor network via bridges or directly via guard nodes. 
These two fit well together.
We also know which IP-version and which obfuscation techniques clients use. 
But that's about it with clients and relays. 

Clients:   
Client data is on purpose quite sparse and we can't make much more than compare numbers of clients with the much more detailed data about the relays that make up the tor network. 
We will eg not be able to follow clients through the network.

Countries:   
The most detailed view we can get on clients is their distribution by country. This is interesting since we know also from each relay in which country it is related. And we know a lot about relays. So maybe we can construct some useful views on specific characteristics of relays and total numbers of clients by country.

Relays:   
Additionally to the data on relays and bridges we have quite specific data on different types of relays (but not bridges), namely guards, middle nodes, exits and directory servers. 
This data is detailed but not easy to handle. 
Numbers for the different types of relays don't add up to the total number of relays since each relay can (and most often does) serve more than one purpose and implements two, three or all four types of relays besides bridges.   
We know for each relay with which probability it is part of a clients route through the network, but we would need to agggregate averages and mean deviations to add some meaning to these numbers. 
We also know for most relays through which AS they are connected but this is a very large number of different AS which we first need to aggregate to find the most used ones and how high the concentration is. 
We then have some flags and exit port information which again are not particularily easy to visualize (and interpret).

Bridges:    
Last not least we have some data about bridges, but not as much as about relays. This is again on purpose since bridges serve to circumvent attempts to block the access to the tor network alltogether. Gathering too much information about them would make the censors job easier. 
What's fortunate about bridges is that they are mutually exclusive to relays. So at least these numbers add up.
Apart from that we don't know much more than a few technicalities that don't have much impact on the rest of the network: from which bridge pool they were assigned, which transport they use and if they are hosted in the EC2 cloud. 


**Import aggregation**
There's one field in the initial relay collection that has to be aggregated inside MongoDB and that's bwp (bandwidth actually provided).
	
	TODO



**Import checks**
We are making assumptions about the imported data that wouldn't hurt to be checked. 
The following query checks if Bridges and all other types of relays are really disjunct sets:

	TODO



**Topical aggregation**
* consolidate relays: bridges + guard nodes + middle nodes + exit nodes + directory servers
* consolidate anonymity: guard nodes + middle nodes + exit nodes
* consolidate censorship circumvention: bridges + directory servers

Relay data by country like tsv, osv, upt, bwp and bwc could even be split up to the type level but I have no idea how to visualize that properly. 
Implementation would not be difficult (just a different combination of the steps already implemented above) but would still use quite some time and resources. Seems superfluous right now.   
Maybe just for gmed (guard-middle-exit-dir) and bridges?    
Maybe it' the other way round and the a1-relay collection is superfluous? It certainly can be constructed from gmed and bridges.
The utility of flags is also a little unclear.

The client collection doesn't need any further aggregation since it is - as described above - already aggregated when it is imported into the Database. For indices see below.


_scattering / spreading / evenness of distribution_
So far we're only gathering all AS and how many nodes are connected to them. 
With a little more statistical knowledge and effort (hint hint) we could derive some facts about e.g. evenness of distribution.    
Maybe also bandwidth data could benefit from such measures.   
Who else?

	TODO
	
	
_supporting indices over relay_
Indices over the imported relay collection can probably speed up aggregation considerably. 
I didn't test this but it really seems reasonable and since the aggregation task is quite massive the overhead in time and space to generate these indices seems justified.

	FOR			OVER 	INCLUDING FIELDS
	a1-country	relay	country+date+type
	a1-relays	relay	date -> use date+type
	a1-gmed		relay	date+type


_aggregation mdularization_
With so much aggregation taking place it should be tried to prevent aggregation steps more than once for different views but build them on each other like a pyramid.   
Especially the country collection has a lot of overlap with other views.    
Maybe it would be good to seperate GMED and Bridges in the import collections

	TODO

	
	
**Formal aggregation**

This means aggregations over time and space. 
Time quite obviously translates to the ability watch the data from the finest level available - hourly - to an overview that shows the whole timespan available - currently 5 years - in a single view. The equivalent to zooming in and out. 
Space translates to the ability to group countries to meaningful regions, either continents or geopolitical regions like "arab spring countries".

_timedate intervals / periods_   
The default timespan is 1 hour for relays and 24 hours for clients. At a scale of 1 pixel per default timespan we can't see the whole data on a regular display.
So far we collected about 5 years of data so far, which leads the following numbers of pixels   
	5					5		years since 2008
	5 x 12				60		months
		   x 4			240 	weeks
	       x 30			1800	days
	       						// so, if 1px isn't to fine for our weary eyes, on a regular display 
	       						// we can show about half of the available data on a per day basis
	            x 4		2200	6 hours, quarter day
	            x24		43200	hourly

We will want to zoom in and out of the data visualization and henceforth need to define aggregated timespans. 
Sensible spans coudl be
	6h		6 hours
	1d		24 hours, 1 day
	1w		168 hours, 7 days, 1 week
	1m		1 month, about 4 weeks, about 30.5 days
If we skip months as too coarse anyway (but actually because they are so unwieldy irregular) we could get by with 4 possible integer values: 1, 6, 24, 168

We probably need to pre-aggregate these timespans in MongoDB (which provides map/reduce functionality and an "aggregation framework". Maybe the [Cube](https://github.com/square/cube) project (based on D3.js) can be used. 

_continents and political regions_

	TODO
	


**Indices**

* bridges
* guard nodes
* middle nodes
* exit nodes


**Issues**
Maybe aggregates should use normalized versions of autonomous system data:			
	 gmed		asn		autonomous system normalizd	string	
Would be good to check the DB for how many AS we currently have and if a small number of them is significantly important (I need to learn some statistics terms...).


**Background Information**
Wikipedia has quick introductions to the meaning of [mean](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetisches_Mittel), [median](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) and [mode](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_%28Statistik%29) (the links point to the german edition).

Some material about MongoDB and OLAP  
[MongoDB - Materialized View/OLAP Style Aggregation and Performance (stackoverflow)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11810911/mongodb-materialized-view-olap-style-aggregation-and-performance)  
[Another useful thread on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3478916/what-should-i-choose-mongodb-cassandra-redis-couchdb), see especially the second answer

Visualization Interface Wishlist
--------------------------------
* chrome colors green and purple
* coloring of data should be readable for color blind people
* selecting countries by region, by other criterias (eg number of relays), on a map etc
* visualize countries on a fisheye map, with suitable projection
* selecting time period by widget, zoom in/out, move left/right in time
* ability to change scale on vertical axis
* ensure that any field not accessible through predefined vis options is accessible through gerneric interface
* combine criteria eg stable and fast relays runnix linux with OS version xy in country z
* combine/add/stack graphs to show complete datasets (eg cake diagrams)
* SVG export
* [future] consumed bandwidth between relays  

this list is unsorted

Some useful links:  
[Topojson](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/)  
[Fisheye](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/fisheye/)  




Visualization Mechanics Wishlist
--------------------------------
* notify the client of new fields so he can add them to the generic interface 
* RESTfulness: having the URL represent the complete state of a visualization e.g. including zoom factor, 
  active facets, selected clipping etc




JavaScript Issues
-----------------

_framework_
still not sure which framework to use. something lightweight should suffice. 
angular.js maybe to involved. 
knockout.js like angular.js takes a declarative approach.
can.js doesn't have that declarative touch but apart from that looks very promising.
  
_datetime_    
Handling of date and time can get difficult with JavaScript because not every environment handles every possible datetime format equally well. 
Besides the ubiquitious UTC-epoch format which is rather inaccessable to humans we settle on "YYYY-MM-DD HH" as defined in ISO-8601 which is supported across all browsers and serves our needs just well.   
If D3.js doesn't provide all we need we may use the [Moment.JS](http://momentjs.com) library which "was designed to work both in the browser and in Node.JS". 
For further discussion of the topic see [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1056728/formatting-a-date-in-javascript).




Data Import
-----------
An importer tool takes metrics descriptors as input and produces JSON or BSON to be imported into MongoDB. 
Such a tool should use Stem, which is a Python library that parses all relevant metrics descriptors. 
I think it even has an export function that may or may not support JSON. 
See Tor ticket #6171 for more details: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6171.  
[import.py](visionion/blob/master/import/import.py) is a simple data importer that uses Stem to read consensuses and server descriptors and that prints out dicts that could be imported into MongoDB.




Next Steps
----------
* sketches of a visualization
* more documentation of pre-import aggregation (extract from karsten's mails)
* aggregation of visualization primitives and timespans
* figure out how to control MongoDB via external scripts   
		http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/write-scripts-for-the-mongo-shell/
		e.g. prompt:> mongo localhost:27017/tor ~/visionion/aggregation.js
  particularily aggregation, indexing and status/control-queries
* Then a prototype visualization of some graph will be the first occassion to connect the database, the web application framework and the visualization library.
* When that's accomplished more experiments need to be conducted to see if it's really possible to have more than one D3 instances on one webpage and how they can interact.
* Then the real work on the visualizations can begin.
